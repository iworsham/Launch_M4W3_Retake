### Maintaining Current-User

This application includes some starter code so that we could maintain a current user.  Review the Login and Logout code in the Home Controller, along with the Login and Logout buttons in the Home/Index.cshtml file.  Building on this pre-existing structure:
* Create a cookie that holds a key for "currentUser" when a user logs in.
* Delete that cookie when a user logs out.
* Add the value of "current user" to all views
